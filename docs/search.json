Arrangements have been made with the directors of these programs to facilitate the involvment of these students and avoid conflicting schedules.\nApplication from students enrolled in other MPhil programs at UCT are also welcome. We expect these students to make arrangements in their respective schedule in order to be available for the whole duration of the masterclass. To justify an absence for a course, we can upon request provide an official letter of participation explaning the content of the masterclass and its learning outcomes.\nHow can I apply and what is the deadline?\nFill this online form to apply. Applications are due Wesnesday 8th of March 2023.\nParticipants will be notified of their acceptance by email before the 15th of March 2023.\nHow many seats are available?\nThe masterclass can host about 10 students from UCT.\nWhat is expected from me?\nWe expect you to join the masterclass with lots of questions and motivation, collaborate with students coming from France and Nigeria, and get involved for the entire duration of the masterclass.\nWe will provide transport for all activities taking place outside of UCT, either leaving from the upper campus or from the Lenox Guest House, depending on the day’s schedule. For the participant-led projects, each group will be allocated a budget to cover travel expenses related to fieldwor.\nYou will be welcome to join us at the guest house in Gardens for our daily Debrief & Discussion.\nBut Friday 7th is a public holiday?\nWe are aware of this issue, but to make the most of this masterclass, we expect you to participate this Friday and the following Saturday until mid-afternoon.

    "text": "Welcome!\nThe International Masterclass on “Digital Technologies in the African city” will take place from Monday, April 3rd to Tuesday, April 12th 2023, at the University of Cape Town.\nThe purpose of the masterclass is to bring together graduate students enrolled in Nigeria, France and South Africa, and interested in researching how digital technologies transform cities within and beyond the context of Cape Town, one of Africa’s major tech hubs.\nThe instructional program involves guest lectures, collective workshops and site visits, and participant-led research projects. The panel of guest speakers includes leading voices from academia and from the local tech industry.\nFrom data centres to smartphone apps, tech firms to platform workers, finance to mobilities, we will collectively question, from the perspective of urban studies and social sciences, how digital technologies reshape urban spaces, transform economies and affect daily livelihoods.\nAbout twenty participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire program.\nThis event is organised by the Department of Geography from the Ecole Normale Supérieure, the African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town, with the financial support of the PSL Translitterae program and the French Research Institute of South Africa, and the assistance of IFRA-Nigeria.\nThe co-organizers of the masterclass are Pauline Guinard (ENS) and Julien Migozzi (Oxford University).\n\nCall for applications\nApplications for UCT students are now open. Please consult the section Applying. Application materials are due Wednesday, March 8th, 2013."

The easiest option to so do is upon arrival at the Cape Town airport: local companies such as MTN or Vodafone are located immediately at the exit of international arrivals, on the right-hand side. The procedure takes about 10 minutes."

Welcome to the International Masterclass on "Digital Technologies in the African city"!

This event is organised by the Department of Geography from the [Ecole Normale Supérieure](https://www.ens.psl.eu/), the [African Centre for Cities](https://www.africancentreforcities.net/) at the University of Cape Town, with the financial support of the [PSL Translitterae program](https://www.psl.eu/en/translitterae) and the  [French Research Institute of South Africa](http://www.ifas.org.za/research/), and the assistance of [IFRA-Nigeria](https://www.ifra-nigeria.org/).

The masterclass will gather 20 graduate students enrolled in Nigeria, France and South Africa for 8 days of guest lectures, workshops and fieldwork. We will question and research how digital technologies, from data centres to smartphone apps, and from tech firms to platform users, transform cities, reshape urban economies and affect daily livelihoods, within and beyond the context of Cape Town, one of Africa's major tech hubs.

The masterclass will take place from April 3rd to April 12th 2023.

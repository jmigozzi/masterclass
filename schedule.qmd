After three days of guest lectures and collective fieldwork, participants will decide to work on one of the 4 research topics proposed by the organizers. Participants will then design a collective research protocol, working in small groups for the rest of the masterclass, under the supervision of organizers and research assistants.

Please note that this program is preliminary and is subject to modifications.

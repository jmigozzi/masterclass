The first three days combine guest speakers from academia and from the tech ecosystem of Cape Town, with collective fieldwork. 

Participants will then select one of four research topics introduced by the organizers, and design a collective research protocol, working in small groups for the rest of the masterclass.

Please note that this program is preliminary and subject to modifications.

 - Unless specified, all guest lectures and workshops will take place on the UCT campus in the [Centlivres Building](https://goo.gl/maps/Ptpxv3QcnV6yCzGx8) in the south end of the upper campus.

 - Unless specified, every Debrief & Discussion will take place at the Lenox Guest House. Provisions have been taken to allow for UCT students to enter the premises upon presentation of their student cards.

- Friday 7th is a public holiday in South Africa: the masterclass will nonetheless takes place on that day. The following Sunday and Monday will be considered as days off.

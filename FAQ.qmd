-   **Can I apply to the masterclass?**

    Any student enrolled in the MPhil in Southern Urbanism or in the Mphil Critical Urbanism are encouraged to apply. Have a look at the program!

    If you are not enrolled to these programs, you can reach out to explain your motivation and interests.

-   **How many seats are available?**

    The masterclass can host about 10 students from UCT.

-   **What is expected from me if I join?**

    We expect you to join the masterclass with lots of questions and motivations, collaborate with students coming from France and Nigeria, and participate during the entire duration of the program. Arrangements have already been made with your MPhil directors to facilitate your presence in terms of schedule.

    Funding for transport will be provided during the duration of the fieldwork. You will be also welcome to spend time with the other participants at our guest house in Gardens.

-   **But Friday 7th is a public holiday?**

    We are aware of it, but to make the most of this masterclass, we expect you to participate this Friday and the following Saturday until mid-afternoon. Sunday 9th and Monday 10th remain days off.

-   **How do I apply?**

    Send a short motivation paragraph to julien.migozzi\[\@\]ouce.ox.ac.uk and laura.nkula\[\@\]uct.ac.za.

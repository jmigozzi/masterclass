-   **Are there participation fees?**

    Participation is free.

-   **Can I apply to the masterclass?**

    Any student enrolled in the MPhil in Southern Urbanism or in the MPhil in Critical Urbanisms are strongly encouraged to apply.

    Other MPhil students enrolled at UCT can also apply. We would expect you to make arrangements in your own schedule in order to be available for the whole duration of the masterclass. To that end, we can upon request provide an official letter in case you need to justify an absence for a class of your program. 

-   **How can I apply and what is the deadline?**

    Send [us](mailto:%20julien.migozzi@ouce.ox.ac.uk,%20laura.nkula@uct.ac.za,%20pauline.guinard@ens.fr) a CV and a short movitivation letter for joining the master class <ins>before the 10th of March 2023</ins>.
    
    Participants will be notified of their acceptance by email before the 15th of March 2023. 

-   **How many seats are available?**

    The masterclass can host about 10 students from UCT.

-   **What is expected from me?**

    We expect you to join the masterclass with lots of questions and motivation, collaborate with students coming from France and Nigeria, and participate for the entire duration of the program. Arrangements have already been made with directors of the MPhil programs to facilitate your presence for the whole duration of the masterclass and avoid conflicts with your own program's schedule.

    We will provide organize transport for any activity happening outside of the UCT campus, and cover transport costs for your fieldwork. You will be also welcome to spend time with the other participants at our guest house in Gardens for the daily Debrief & Discussion.

-   **But Friday 7th is a public holiday?**

    We are aware of it, but to make the most of this masterclass, we expect you to participate this Friday and the following Saturday until mid-afternoon. Sunday 9th and Monday 10th remain days off.

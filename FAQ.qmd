    The masterclass is open to UCT graduate students. 
    
    The priority is given to students enrolled in the MPhil in Southern Urbanism or in the MA in Critical Urbanisms, hosted at the African Centre for Cities at UCT. Arrangements have been made with directors of these to facilitate the involvnebt of students and avoid conflicting schedules.

    Application from students from other MPhil programs are also welcome. We expect these students to make arrangements in their respective schedule in order to be available for the whole duration of the masterclass. To justify an absence for a course, we can upon request provide an official letter of participation explaning the content of the masterclass and its learning outcomes.

-   **How many seats are available?**

    The masterclass can host about 10 students from UCT.

-   **What is expected from me?**

    We expect you to join the masterclass with lots of questions and motivation, collaborate with students coming from France and Nigeria, and get involved for the entire duration of the masterclass. 

    We will provide transport for all activities taking place outside of the UCT campus, and cover transport costs for group activities. You will be welcome to spend time with the other participants at the guest house in Gardens for our daily Debrief & Discussion.

-   **But Friday 7th is a public holiday?**

    We are aware of this issue, but to make the most of this masterclass, we expect you to participate this Friday and the following Saturday until mid-afternoon. Sunday 9th and Monday 10th remain days off.
